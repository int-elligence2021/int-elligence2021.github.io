## About:
  Recipes found online often contain ingredients which may not be easily available or need to be bought. To solve this problem, ‘int elligence;’ will design a website to allow users to be more resourceful and also produce less waste when cooking. The website will utilise an API database to suggest various recipes based solely on the ingredients which are currently available as well as any additional requirements to suit the user’s needs . These requirements include filtering recipes by dietary requirements, cooking time, cuisine, nutritional value, meal type and it will also include a negative search filter (i.e. excluded ingredients). The website will also display recipes with modified ingredient amounts based upon the user's preferred serving size and also find recipes that may contain one or two extra ingredients as to what the user inputs. The final solution, created within 6 weeks, should be innovative, easy to use and efficient whilst maintaining a high level of aesthetics in a simplistic design.
